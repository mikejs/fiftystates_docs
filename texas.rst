  - Jurisdiction

    + House: each committee is assigned jurisdiction over a specific subject matter
    + Senate: no official jurisdictions, but unofficial assignments exist and are generally followed

  - Membership

    + House: determined in part by seniority and in part by the Speaker
    + Senate: determined completely by the Lt. Governor

  - Referral

    + House: by the Speaker according to subject matter
    + Senate: by the Lt. Governor as he/she sees fit (generally observing unofficial committee
      jurisdictions)

    impact statement is required. If so, the Legislative Budget Board will prepare the note or
    statement, consulting other state agencies as necessary.
    
    + House: fiscal note must be attached to the bill before the first
      public hearing and the note will be attached to the bill if it is reported from committee

      the note will be included as part of the committee report

      after a bill is reported from committee) but must be distributed to legislators
      immediately on completion.
  
  - All committee business is required to be conducted in open meetings. No official
    action or votes may be taken except in public meetings.
